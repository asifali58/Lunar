## Transporortation:
- Establishing a transportation system between Earth and the Moon is crucial.
- Concepts include reusable spececraft, lunar shuttles, or a lunar space elevator.
## Habitats:
- Lunar habitas need to provide a safe and sustainable environment for humans.
- These habitats might be located on the lunar surface, in lunar caves, or in orbit around the moon.
## Life Support Systems:
- Closed loop life support systems would be essential to recycle air, water, and other rources to sustain human life for extended periods.
## Power Generation:
- Solar power is a common proposal for lunar colonies due to the Moon's exposure to sunlight for about 14 Earth days at a time.
- Alternatively, nuclear power could be considered.
